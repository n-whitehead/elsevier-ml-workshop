    "This lesson is intended to help introduce you to programming with Python, and the Jupyter Notebook environment. For those with Python and Jupyter Notebook experience I recommended to skip this lesson, as it is aimed at an audience with little to no prior experience with these tools.\n",
    "\n",

    "You will execute code within the code blocks of this \"scaffolding\". There is no need to update the Markdown unless an inaccuracy is found. If an error in the code or Markdown is found, then please submit a pull request to our [GitHub](https://github.com/n-whitehead/elsevier-machine-learning) - Thanks!"

    "Since you are able to view this notebook, you should find yourself in an environment with suffix path ```/lab```. A Jupyter Lab is simply a Jupyter Notebook extension to make the notebook more modular, and pleasant to navigate. Note you can open multiple notebook tabs, or view file structure on the left hand side. You can enter the traditional Jupyter Notebook by replacing ```/lab``` with ```/tree```. For reference in these lessons, I will refer to files with extension ```.ipynb``` as notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is organized into blocks called 'cells.'  Each cell can contain either code or markdown.  You can 'run' the cell by clicking the little forward-arrow symbol in the toolbar at the top of the page, or by pressing [Shift-Enter].  For a code cell, this will execute the Python code in that cell, and then display any result that code produces below.  For a markdown cell (like this one), it will transform the markdown text into a textbook-style text.  If you double click on a markdown cell, you can edit the raw text, and then 'run' it to re-compile the pretty $\\LaTeX$ version.  For more about the things you can do with markdown, check out this [cheat-sheet for markdown commands](https://medium.com/ibm-data-science-experience/markdown-for-jupyter-notebooks-cheatsheet-386c05aeebed)\n",
