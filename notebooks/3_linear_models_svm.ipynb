    "## Decision Boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to shift our way of thinking about classification from directly classifying new examples based on old ones, to directly modeling a function to separate classes (ie. creating boundaries). The **discriminant** is a function that models decision boundaries between classes. In a bounded space, a novel data point will simply belong to the class it is bounded by. This bounded region is known as the **decision region**. Like all frameworks we choose, there are trade-offs we must consider. In the case of classification, creating decision region between classes depends on how complex the discriminant is. If the discriminant is simple (compared to the class data point distribution) then this is a good approach. However, if the data presents ambiguous overlap between class distributions, then this method will not make accurate predictions. In theory, using very complex, non-linear discriminants to approximate boundaries sounds nice, and can potentially separate boundaries perfectly. In practice, however, it often results in a space that is intractable, and a hypothesis space that may not prove to be accurate when presented with novel examples."

The two-dimensional plane the distribution exists in is separated into three distinct sections by two or three purple discriminant lines. Here is where the intuition behind our trade-off begin to take effect. The image on the left is divided by linear boundaries, which is performant for many classes but lacks predictive accuracy (notice the red \"1s\" creeping into the blue \"3s\" boundary). The image on the right will improve on the linear models accuracy by generating non-linear boundaries, quadratic in this case, at the expense of an irregular hypothesis space. This example is trivial enough that a non-linear boundary for three classes is feasible, however, if we consider examples with many dimensions and many classes, then generating non-linear function boundaries becomes much harder to manage.\n",

    "Let us once again consider the mathematics behind our newly found intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say \"linear\" we mean the boundary will be a **hyperplane** (or **decision surface**), which is 1 dimension less than our original feature space. In two-dimensions this hyperplane is a line, but in higher dimensions we can still refer to this as a \"linear\" model. In low dimensional spaces, the concept of a hyperplane is immediately obvious. However in much higher dimensions it becomes nearly impossible to conceptualize, let alone determine which boundary a data point exists. Luckily, there is only one trick you need to know to determine which side of a hyperplane you are on. Consider the feature vector $\\mathbf{a}=[a_1\\:\\dots\\:a_n]$, and a **normal** vector $\\mathbf{w}=[w_1\\:\\dots\\:w_n]$ that is a unit vector orthogonal to the proposed hyperplane boundary. Project the point onto a line perpendicular to the hyperplane using a **dot product** of vectors, written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}=\\sum_{i=1}^n{a_iw_i}=a_1w_1+\\dots+a_nw_n\n",
    "\\label{3.1}\\tag{3.1}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the normal vector $\\mathbf{w}$ is a **basis** vector for each vector in our feature space, we can project data points onto it. The dot product will encode each projected data point as a single scalar value, which is effectively the distance from the origin along the vector. We can choose a scalar threshold value, $b$, such that projections belong to one class if $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}+b<0$, and the other class if $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}+b>0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our data point can be correctly classified by this hyperplane boundary, then we say the classes are **linearly separable**. If no hyperplane exists that can separate our classes correctly, we say our data is not linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we choose how many boundaries exist for our dataset? Well, it is trivial to show a single boundary can separate two classes of data points. If we are presented with more than two classes we need multiple decision boundaries. The typical approach is to use a *one-vs-all* method, meaning there will be one decision boundary per class. This can lead to some problems, specifically where a new point lies in a region intersected by more than one hyperplane. There are several algorithms that exist to choose a hyperplane, most notably is through \"gradient descent\", which works by picking a random candidate split plane, and repeatedly making small adjustments to it in ways that reduce the error measure. While this level of specificity is beyond the scope of this lesson, if this subject is interesting to you I encourage you to read about techniques for generating \"good\" hyperplane boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see, finding the \"best\" boundary hyperplane is non-trivial. There may be choices that give perfect accuracy on a training set, or there may be none. In either case, let's first explore a linear technique for generating boundaries."

Dimensionality reduction will be covered in much greater detail in Lesson 8, but for now we will use it as a tool to create boundaries in two-class datasets. We attempt to find a transformation representation of our data samples by projecting the samples onto a plane of one less dimension. You can effectively run the LDA repeatedly as a form of dimensionality reduction, but this is not advised for classification problems. Typically, you want to project your data into a space one dimension less, then apply some other classification algorithm to the projected data.\n",

LDA attempts to resolve this issue by finding a *distinct* linear boundary via changing the representation of the original data. \n",
